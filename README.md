# Rust-Code-Snippets

While trying to write some aplications in Rust I found myself recurently searching for some thing.

Usualy I find the information I need online but I decided to create a collection of the snippets I mostly need.

If you find anything usefull feel free to use.

If you find anything that can be improved please feel free to commit updates. (Contributions are greatly apreciated)

Also I found some nice snippets here: https://github.com/hhatto/rust-snippets
